name: User Interface Designs

The user interface designs were created using some [templates for Google Drawings created by Morten Just](http://mortenjust.com/2010/04/19/a-wireframe-kit-for-google-drawings/ "mortenjust.com"). The prototype will follow the same colour scheme as the designs but is likely to change as the project progresses. These designs are limited to four of the most used pages, other pages will follow a similar style. 

The first design is of the first page a user will be presented with when visiting the site (after the devices have been setup and named):
